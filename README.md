# WMIRROR

A really simple and minimal script for mirroring websites, it does what it is supposed to do really ezi, for more heavy clone using httrack or something else.

wmirror allows you to download any website from the Internet to a local directory, building recursively all directories, getting HTML, images, and other files from the server to your computer.
